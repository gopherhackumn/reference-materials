Alright, this is the big leagues. You have someone’s Public Key. This isn’t unusual, if you want to send someone an encrypted message,
you have to have thier public key. Your job is to evaluate this public key, and obtain the value of the secret exponent or decryption
exponent (The value of “d” in an RSA encryption).
